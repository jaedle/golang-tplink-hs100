## Usage

### With a project using go modules

install library `go get github.com/jaedle/golang-tplink-hs100`

### Without using go modules

install library `go get github.com/jaedle/golang-tplink-hs100/...`

### Usage example

use the following code as main and replace `YOUR_HS100_DEVICE` with the 
address of your HS100-device.

```golang
package main

import (
	"github.com/jaedle/golang-tplink-hs100/pkg/configuration"
	"github.com/jaedle/golang-tplink-hs100/pkg/hs100"
	"os"
)

func main() {
	h := hs100.NewHs100("YOUR_HS100_DEVICE", configuration.Default())

	name, err := h.GetName()
	if err != nil {
		println("Error on accessing device")
		os.Exit(1)
	}

	println("Name of device: " + name)
}
```

## Device discovery

It is possible to discover devices automatically.
Because this library uses tcp communication this requires to specify a subnet by CIDR notation.
For this example all ips from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.255 will be tried out as an hs100-device.

```golang
package main

import (
	"github.com/jaedle/golang-tplink-hs100/pkg/hs100"
	"log"
)

func main() {
	devices := hs100.Discover("192.168.2.0/24")

	log.Printf("Found devices: %d", len(devices))
	for _, d := range devices {
		name, _ := d.GetName()
		log.Printf("Device name: %s", name)
	}
}
```
